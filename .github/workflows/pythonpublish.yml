Note, using numpy==1.16.0 as a workaround for some weird fails on Travis, in principle we should work with numpy>=1.13.3. We should not need to install fsspec explicitly, but at the moment are getting import errors in the tests due to fsspec not being present - should remove in future, probably when dask version is increased.
