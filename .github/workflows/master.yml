# This workflow will install Python dependencies, run tests and lint with a variety of Python versions
# For more information see: https://help.github.com/actions/language-and-framework-guides/using-python-with-github-actions
#
# This workflow should be an exact duplicate of 'Python package' in
# pythonpackage.yml, except that it only runs on pushes to master. This is done
# so that we can refer to this workflow specifically in the status badge in
# README.md
